## Hi, I'm George!

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a keen interest in turning ideas into reality.

### 💻 Tech Stack

- **Java**: My programming language of choice.
- **SpringBoot/Micronaut**: Leveraging the power of these frameworks for building robust and scalable applications.
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**: I am a firm believer in designing software that reflects the real-world domain it serves. DDD guides my approach to creating maintainable and expressive code.
- **Clean Architecture**: Following the principles of clean code and separation of concerns, I strive to build systems that are modular, testable, and adaptable.
- **Cloud**: Embracing the cloud to deploy, scale, and maintain applications with services like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
